    <h2>Understand time vs. priorities</h2>
    <p>There’s a really good chance you’ve told yourself that you don’t have time to complete a task. But, if you stop to think about it, you do have time. You have allowed other tasks to take priority.Understanding your top priorities and allocating necessary time for important tasks make for solid time management skills. It also helps you organize your daily calendar so you can stay on track throughout the day.Take a look at your current task list and organize by priority by considering two factors—the task’s value and the risk of not completing it. Then tackle your to-do list by assigning allocated time to each task.</p>
    <h2>Give your undivided attention and avoid multitasking</h2>
    <p>Time management is being present with your task at hand while knowing what comes next. Try giving your full attention to your present task until it’s time to jump to the next one. Limit your distractions and be intentional when you need to take a break. Avoid multitasking because your brain is not programmed to handle numerous tasks at once. Juggling multiple projects and switching between tasks require your brain to stop and refocus.It can take up to 15 minutes for your brain to finally get back to a productive state. Multitasking also puts you at risk for making up to 50% more errors.</p>
    <h2>Empower yourself to say “no”</h2>
    <p>Saying “no” is not always easy, but it is a way of establishing boundaries with yourself and those around you. When a new task comes your way that can wait until later or that you cannot take on, be comfortable saying “no.” You can then explain your current priorities and, if necessary, offer a realistic expectation of when you could address their request.</p>
    <h2>Consider tomorrow</h2>
    <p>Time management helps you understand what needs to be prioritized today and what can wait until tomorrow. However, don’t overlook tomorrow’s time and priorities. Likely, you’re going to be just as busy and dedicated to tomorrow’s tasks.When you push tasks to another day, be sure to not procrastinate. If you find yourself continuously procrastinating a task or project, take a moment to reflect on your motivations to understand why you are struggling to start.</p>
    <h2>Don’t underestimate the power of a few minutes</h2>
    <p>Short breaks here and there add up to be a big chunk of your day. Taking breaks helps you rest and reset. By managing your time wisely, you can take full advantage of your rest time to either check a task or two off your to-do list or give your brain a break.</p>
    <h2>Make time for your distractions</h2>
    <p>It’s incredibly easy to get sidetracked when focusing on a task. Even getting up to stretch or taking a bathroom break can open the door to mind-numbing distractions.You can manage your time better if you schedule in moments to take breaks during your day. Schedule a 15-minute break every 75 to 90 minutes. Taking frequent breaks allows your brain to retain information better than if you were to skip it.But remember, be intentional during your focused time and channel your motivation to get back to the grind when time’s up.</p>
    <h2>Stick to it, but refine as needed</h2>
    <p>Having strong time management skills takes dedication, but it can be done. Eventually, the planning, organizing, and dedication will become second nature.If you are still struggling to manage your time, look into alternative approaches like blocking out time on your calendar for designated tasks, using a simple to-do list, or explore why you are not able to complete a certain task or project.</p>
