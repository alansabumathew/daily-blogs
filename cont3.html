    <p>The Redmi Note 10T 5G was launched as another variant in the Redmi Note series and its specifications make the phone good enough for gaming. It costs Rs Rs 14,999 for the entry-level model and we liked the phone for what it brings for that price. The Redmi Note 10T 5G comes with a 6.5-inch full-HD+ display with up to a 90Hz refresh rate and a 20:9 aspect ratio, MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC with up to 6GB RAM, and a 5000mAh battery that will help you have the Chicken Dinner. </p>

    <p>The Poco M3 Pro 5G is also a phone that we would recommend to gamers who are on a budget. The Poco M3 Pro 5G sports a 6.55-inch Full-HD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. It is powered by an octa-core Mediatek Dimesity 700 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. A 48-megapixel triple rear camera setup and an 8-megapixel sensor for selfies are there, too.

    <p>Motorola recently expanded its 5G lineup with the addition of G51 5G. This phone takes inspiration from the Motorola Moto G 5G. The best part about this phone is the stock Android software that makes it easy to navigate the interface. The Moto G51 5G comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 Pro processor, which is slightly better than the vanilla version and that means better gaming performance. The Motorola Moto G51 5G sells for Rs 14,999 on Flipkart. </p>
    <h2>Realme Narzo 50A </h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ke5qtC6oL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Realme’s Narzo series of smartphones has mostly been about big specifications at a small price. The company touts that this series is meant for youngsters, who like to play a lot of games. And the Narzo 50A is no exception. The phone has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, which is good enough to handle modest gaming. It has a 6.5-inch HD+ display, which is a big size, so you will not have issues firing that gun. The Realme Narzo 50A starts at Rs 11,499 and it is available on Flipkart, Amazon, and Realme’s online store. </p>
